# Circuit Not Included
- This project is an Oxygen Not Included mod, which focuses on bringing a new way to construct logic circuits in the game. Now you will be able to create your own circuits and automate your base in a new way. This mod is especially useful for those who like to create complex systems in the game, such as smart automation, complex sensors, and more. This mod doesn't add new logic or features to the game, it just allows you to compact your own circuits without occupying a lot of space and materials in your base.

# TODO
- [ ] Finalize the circuit DTO validation, to avoid invalid circuits (ValidateResult and ValidateAnim).
- [ ] Insert the sprite circuits based on the circuit size, maybe one animation controller per tile...
- [ ] Check what happens when i build a circuit in the game and quit.
- [ ] Find a way to save the circuit for the specific save file.
- [ ] Load each circuit every time the game loads a save file.
- [ ] Unload the circuit when the player exit the save.
- [ ] Check constantly if still any circuit in the save, and delete it if not.
- [ ] Create an UI to manage the circuits.
